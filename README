This project contains three parts:
1. The original SimBGP is extended to include the implementation of DIMR(Disjoint Interdomain Multipath Routing), PDAR(Path Diversity Aware Routing), RBGP(Resilient BGP), YAMR(Yet Another Multipath Routing) and BGPXM(BGP eXtended Multipath). 
2. A bash script is provided to automatically run the experiment.
3. Some awk or bash scripts are provided to show the statistics of the data.

The files and directories:
README      This file.
data/       All data.
src/        Source files of SimBGP.
